Them are files
Them are not
Oh yes they are!
See them interfaces?
Well I'll be

All matlab code (hopefully) adopts the convention of prefixing any "java"
variables with j_.  If you modify the code, please respect this convention.
Eventually, I'd like to put java code mostly in separate files.

For info on the server side / python code / apache setup, look for the
README in the server_code directory.


NOTES

Current philosophy (somewhat due to limitations in the matlab hdf5 file
interface)...

- View properties are stored with _versions_ of a dataset.  That is, if you
  change the color of an ROI, you create a _new_ version of that ROI with a new
  color.  This improves our ability to specify a URI for a picture and know
  easily which displayed thing goes with which URI.

GOTCHAS

Make sure the files on the repos are read/writeable by the apache user or group!

CURRENT PROBLEMS

matlab seems unable to modify existing entities, including metadata in an hdf5
file.  There seems to be no way to delete.  This is annoying.

matlab always reports full "path" names.  Thus, there is a recurring phenomena
of doing a h5name(length(h5loc.Name)+2:end) thing to strip off the leading path

We don't check to see if we have a pre-loaded ROI with the same name already
